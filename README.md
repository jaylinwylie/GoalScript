# Introduction
**GolScript** is a goal-tracking language designed to help individuals effectively manage tasks and goals in a structured, assembly-code-like format. It's particularly suited for users who appreciate detailed breakdowns of tasks, dependencies, and conditions, enabling a clear pathway to goal completion.
## GolScript Structure

- **Goals (`GOL`)**: Define an overarching objective.

- **Tasks (`TSK`)**: Specific actions required to achieve a goal.

- **Conditions**:
  - **`ALL`**: All listed sub-goals must be completed.
  - **`ANY`**: Any one of the listed sub-goals must be completed.
    - `?` - Marks a condition as optional
    - `!` - Marks a condition as critical.
